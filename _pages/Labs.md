## 🚀 Attacking Web Applications with FFUF

**Platform:** Hack The Box / Manual Practice  
**Skills:** Fuzzing, URL parameter discovery, HTTP methods, hidden directories  
**Summary:**  
Used the `ffuf` tool to fuzz parameters, discover hidden routes, and perform extension brute-force to uncover functionality not visible through standard browsing. Identified hidden PHP endpoints and vulnerable behaviors through crafted requests and wordlists.
