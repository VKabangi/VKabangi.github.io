## ðŸ”§ What is `snmpwalk`?

**`snmpwalk`** is a command-line tool used to query SNMP-enabled devices for detailed information in a tree-like structure. It recursively walks through the SNMP Object Identifier (OID) tree and pulls system data from network devices such as routers, switches, and servers.

This tool is part of the **Net-SNMP** suite and is frequently used in penetration testing and network audits to extract readable SNMP data once a valid community string is identified (e.g., with `onesixtyone`).
